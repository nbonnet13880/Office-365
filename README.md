# Script for Office-365

Different scripts are present on this github. These different scripts were created by myself. These are very often scripts used in production.

**AddContactO365.ps1**
This script allows you to connect to **Exchange online**. We will first proceed to **delete the contacts** if they are present in the csv file. Then we will **create** the new contacts with data in the csv files.
